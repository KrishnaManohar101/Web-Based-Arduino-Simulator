FOSSEE OSHW Winter Internship – 2025

Note: Candidates must register for the FOSSEE Winter Internship – 2025 at 

Internship under the OSHW (Open Source Hardware) Project
The Open Source Hardware (OSHW) group under FOSSEE, IIT Bombay is developing open-source tools for electronics simulation, and virtual laboratories.

As part of this effort, we invite applications from motivated students through a technical screening task designed to evaluate their ability to build end-to-end engineering systems.

Area of Interest
Open Source Electronics Simulation & Educational Tools
This screening task evaluates skills in:
Web-based engineering tool development
Electronics abstraction and modeling
Embedded systems fundamentals
Software-driven hardware simulation

Screening Task (with Detailed Task Description)
Title
Build a Minimal Web-Based Arduino Simulator for LED Control Using a Push Button (with Auto-Wiring, Configurable Pins, and Auto Code Generation)

Background
Modern web-based electronics tools like Wokwi and Circuito.io demonstrate the power of interactive simulation and automatic code generation in electronics learning. The OSHW initiative at FOSSEE aims to build a fully open-source academic platform that brings these capabilities together for education and research.
In this screening task, participants are challenged to develop a minimal functional prototype that supports component selection, automatic pin connections, Arduino code generation, and basic logic-level simulation. The focus is on system integration, engineering correctness, and architectural design, rather than visual appearance or feature completeness.


Task Breakdown 

Candidates are expected to attempt the screening tasks sequentially (Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3). Selection will be based on the number of tasks successfully completed and demonstrated; candidates completing a higher number of tasks will be given preference. Completion of even Task 1 alone may be sufficient for shortlisting, provided it is implemented correctly and demonstrated clearly.

Task 1 – Web-Based Interface & Component Handling
Objective
Design a web-based interface that allows users to visually create a simple Arduino experiment.

User Interface Design Guidelines:
Provide a component palette on the left side of the screen containing the Arduino Uno, LED, and Push Button, from which users can drag components.


Include a central working area (canvas) where users can drag and place components and build the circuit.


Add a toolbar option to switch between component view and code view; when code view is selected, the automatically generated Arduino code should be displayed while keeping the circuit visible.


Include Start and Stop buttons on the canvas to allow users to run and stop the simulation easily.

UI design may be simple; functional correctness is mandatory.
Use Wokwi elements. (Refer the Github links)

Task 2 – Auto-Wiring Logic with Configurable Pins

Objective
Implement automatic component-to-Arduino pin connections with support for user-controlled pin reassignment.

Scope & Constraints
Controller: Arduino Uno only
Components: LED, Push Button


Default Pin Mapping (Mandatory Initial State)
LED → Digital Pin 10
Push Button → Digital Pin 2


The simulator must automatically wire components and generate Arduino code for this default configuration.

Pin Reconfiguration Rules
Arduino digital pins 2 to 13 may be used
One Arduino pin cannot be assigned to more than one component
If LED occupies a pin, that pin must not be available for the push button
If the button occupies a pin, that pin must not be available for the LED
Users must be able to change pin assignments through the UI

Task 3 – Auto Code Generation & Logic-Level Simulation
Objective
Generate Arduino code automatically and simulate the circuit behavior at a logic level.

Auto Code Generation Requirements
Generated code must include:
pinMode()
digitalWrite()
digitalRead()
Whenever pin assignments change:
Wiring must update logically
Arduino code must update automatically
No manual code editing should be required

Simulation Requirements
Logic-level simulation only:
Button pressed → GPIO HIGH
LED ON when GPIO HIGH
LED OFF when GPIO LOW

Scope & Constraints
Controller
Arduino Uno only
Components
LED
Push Button
Default Pin Mapping (Mandatory Initial State)
LED → Digital Pin 10
Push Button → Digital Pin 2

The simulator must automatically generate Arduino code for this default configuration.

The platform must allow the user to change the pin number assigned.

Rules:
Arduino digital pins 2 to 13 may be used
One Arduino pin cannot be assigned to more than one component
If LED occupies a pin (e.g., D10), that pin must not appear as an option for the push button
Likewise, if the button occupies a pin, that pin must be excluded for the LED

The Arduino code must update automatically to reflect the new pin numbers

Automatic Code Update Requirement
Whenever a pin assignment is changed:
The wiring must update logically
The generated Arduino code must update automatically to reflect the new pin numbers
No manual code editing should be required
Mandatory End-to-End Flow
A valid submission must demonstrate the complete workflow below:
→ Select Arduino Uno
→ Drag LED
→ Drag Push Button
→ Auto-wire (LED → D10, Button → D2)
→ Auto-generate Arduino code
→ Change pin numbers
→ Code updates automatically
→ Run simulation
→ Button controls LED

UI design may be simple — functional correctness is mandatory.


Deliverables
Candidates must submit:
1 . Demo Video
Screen recording (no voiceover required)
Demonstrating:
